# color50

A lightweight Python package for colorful output at the command line.

Created as a final project submission for Harvard University's CS50P course,
**color50** is a package I designed to add a little extra flavor to standard
output print statements. This is my first ever attempt at making a Python
package from scratch, and I'm excited to share it with fellow Python developers
and CS50 students.

Modules included:
- color
    - **Color** class
- core_functions
    - ``rgb`` function
    - ``hexcode`` function
    - ``css`` function
- colorstr
    - **ColorStr** class
- constants

To install **color50**, execute the following command using the `pip` installer:

```
pip install color50
```
