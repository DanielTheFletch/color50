# color50

A lightweight Python package for more colorful printing at the terminal.

Created as a final project submission for Harvard University's CS50P course,
**color50** is a package I designed to add a little extra flavor to standard
output print statements. This is my first ever attempt at making a Python
package from scratch, and I'm excited to share it with fellow Python developers
and CS50 students.

Modules included:
    - color
        - **Color** class
    - core_functions
        - ``rgb`` function
        - ``hexcode`` function
        - ``css`` function
    - colorstr
        - **ColorStr** class
    - constants

To install the color50 package, run the following command:
`pip install color50`
