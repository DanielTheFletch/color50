Hello, World!

My name is Daniel Fletcher, and thank you for checking out my project!

Created as a final project submission for Harvard University's CS50P course,
``color50`` is a package designed to add a little extra flavor to standard
output print statements. Who knows, maybe future CS50 students may find this
package useful (or fun)!

This is my first ever attempt at making a Python package, and I'm excited to
finally have it out for others to use.
